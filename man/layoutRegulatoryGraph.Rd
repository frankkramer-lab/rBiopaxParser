\description{
  This function generates a (more or less) beautiful layout
  for a regulatory graph. Call this after you generated a
  graph with pathway2RegulatoryGraph. Since beauty is
  always in the eye of the beholder consider this a
  starting point for making your graphs even nicer.
  Rgraphviz with dot layout is used. Edges are green/red
  with normal/tee arrowheads for activations/inhibitions.
  If you want to specifically paint subgraphs in different
  colors use lists of vectors with node names for parameter
  subgraphs and vector of color names for subgraphs.color
  for your choice of color. The output can be further
  tweaked by setting layout options using
  nodeRenderInfo(mygraph) <- list() ... See the Rgraphviz
  and Graphviz documentations.
