\arguments{
  \item{biopax}{A biopax model}

  \item{id}{string. ID of the instances to select}

  \item{class}{string. Class of the instances to select}

  \item{name}{string. Name of the instances to select}

  \item{includeSubClasses}{logical. If includeSubClasses is
  set to TRUE the class criteria is broadened to include
  all classes that inherit from the given class}

  \item{returnIDonly}{logical. If TRUE only IDs of the
  components are returned. This saves tiem for looking up
  names for every single ID.}
}
\value{
  Returns a data.frame containing all instances conforming
  to the given selection criteria if returnValues=TRUE,
  only the selector for the internal data.frame otherwise.
}
\description{
  Lists all instances that conform to the selection
  criteria. In contrast to selectInstances this function
  returns an easier to read list. This function returns an
  ordered data.frame of class, id and name of the
  instances. Selection criteria are wether instances belong
  to a certain class or have the specified id or name.
  Setting a criteria to NULL ignores this criteria. If
  includeSubClasses is set to TRUE the class criteria is
  broadened to include all classes that inherit from the
  given class, e.g. if class="control" and
  includeSubClasses=TRUE the function will select catalyses
  and modulations too, since they are a subclass of class
  control.

 # list all instances of class "pathway"

 # list all interaction including all subclasses of interactions
