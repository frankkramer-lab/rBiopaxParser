\alias{pathway2AdjacancyMatrix}
\title{This function generates an adjacency matrix from the activations/inhibitions of a pathway in a biopax model.}
\usage{
  pathway2AdjacancyMatrix(biopax, pwid,
    expandSubpathways = TRUE, splitComplexMolecules = TRUE,
    useIDasNodenames = FALSE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{biopax}{A biopax model}

  \item{pwid}{string}

  \item{expandSubpathways}{logical. If TRUE subpathways are
  expanded into this graph, otherwise only this very
  pathway is used.}

  \item{splitComplexMolecules}{logical. If TRUE every
  complex is split up into its components. This leads to
  splitting a single node with name of the complex into
  several nodes with names of the components, these
  components all have identical edges.}

  \item{useIDasNodenames}{logical. If TRUE nodes of the
  graph are named by their molecule IDs instead of using
  the NAME property. This can help with badly
  annotated/formatted databases.}

  \item{verbose}{logical}
}
\value{
  Returns the adjacency matrix representing the regulatory
  graph of the supplied pathway.
}
\description{
  This function internally first calls
  pathway2RegulatoryGraph, then converts the regulatory
  graph to an adjacency matrix. See pathway2RegulatoryGraph
  for more details.
