\title{This function generates the regulatory graph from the activations/inhibitions of a pathway in a biopax model.}
\usage{
  pathway2RegulatoryGraph(biopax, pwid,
    expandSubpathways = TRUE, splitComplexMolecules = TRUE,
    useIDasNodenames = FALSE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{biopax}{A biopax model}

  \item{pwid}{string}

  \item{expandSubpathways}{logical. If TRUE subpathways are
  expanded into this graph, otherwise only this very
  pathway is used.}

  \item{splitComplexMolecules}{logical. If TRUE every
  complex is split up into its components. This leads to
  splitting a single node with name of the complex into
  several nodes with names of the components, these
  components all have identical edges.}

  \item{useIDasNodenames}{logical. If TRUE nodes of the
  graph are named by their molecule IDs instead of using
  the NAME property. This can help with badly
  annotated/formatted databases.}

  \item{verbose}{logical}
}
\value{
  Returns the representing the regulatory graph of the
  supplied pathway in a node-edge-list graph.
}
\description{
  This functions builds a graph from the pathway components
  of the supplied pathway. Only instances of class
  'control' are considered, this leads a functinal graph
  with all edges either representing activations or
  inhibitions. No transports, no translocation, etc. If
  desired complexes can be split up into several nodes,
  this can sometimes lead to a more complex and cluttered
  graph. There can not be multiple edges between 2 nodes.
  Whenever duplicated edges are generated (especially by
  splitting up complexes) a warning is thrown.
